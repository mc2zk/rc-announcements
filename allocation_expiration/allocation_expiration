Dear Rivanna User,

You are receiving this message because the TYPE allocation you requested previously for MYGROUP is set to expire on END_TIME.

Per RC policies, standard and deans’ allocations expire 12 months after they are disbursed. Instructional allocations expire at the end of the semester in which they are granted.

Please see our website https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/allocations for renewal policies.
